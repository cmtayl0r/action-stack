# Responsive Design Strategy

This document outlines the mobile-first responsive design strategy for the Action Stack application.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Mobile-First

We will design and develop for the smallest screen size first and then progressively enhance the layout for larger viewports. This approach ensures a quality experience on mobile and encourages a focus on core functionality.

## 2. Breakpoints

We will use a simple, two-breakpoint system with Tailwind CSS's default naming convention.

- **Base:** No prefix (Mobile, < 768px)
- **`md`:** Medium devices (Tablets, >= 768px)
- **`lg`:** Large devices (Desktops, >= 1024px)

These breakpoints will be used to adjust layouts, typography, and spacing.

## 3. Key Responsive Patterns

### `AppLayout`

- **Mobile:** A single-column layout. The sidebar is hidden and can be toggled via a button in the `Header`.
- **Desktop (`lg`):** A two-column layout with a persistent, visible sidebar.

### `Header`

- **Mobile:** Displays a "hamburger" icon to toggle the sidebar. The main action button may be an icon to save space.
- **Desktop (`lg`):** The hamburger icon is hidden. Full text labels for actions may be displayed.

### Typography

- Font sizes will be fluid, using CSS `clamp()` to scale smoothly between a minimum and maximum size across viewports. This prevents abrupt changes in text size at breakpoints.

### Touch Targets

- **A strict minimum touch target of 44x44 pixels must be enforced for all interactive elements** (buttons, links, checkbox targets). On mobile, padding will be increased on elements to meet this requirement, even if the visual icon inside is smaller.

## 4. Implementation with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind's responsive variants will be used extensively.

```jsx
// Example of a responsive layout change
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {/* This will be a single column on mobile and a 3-column grid on large screens */}
</div>

// Example of a responsive style change
<Button className="p-2 md:p-3">
  {/* This button has more padding on medium screens and up */}
</Button>
```

This strategy ensures that our application is usable and aesthetically pleasing across a wide range of devices, with a strong focus on the mobile experience as required by our project goals.
